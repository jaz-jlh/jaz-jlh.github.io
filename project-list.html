				During my 3rd year at UVA, I started this project along with 5 other MechE majors interested in mechatronics. During the course of this project, we started <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gizmologists">The Gizmologists</a> mechatronics club.
			</p>
			<p>
				Motivation for this project came from the lack of a good clock in a large MechE classroom. We took this opportunity to build a clock from scratch and improve our mechatronics skills along the way.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Major electronic components</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2x stepper motors (minute & hour gears)</li>
				<li>Real Time Clock (RTC)</li>
				<li>LED Strips</li>
				<li>Propeller Mini microcontroller</li>
				<li>Hall Effect sensors</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Our iterative breadboard testing taught us a great deal about debugging. The final version of the electrical system was a single soldered protoboard with pins to allow swapping of Integrated Circuits (ICs). We included Hall Effect sensors on the rotating gears for error correction. They behave like encoders, ensuring the clock displays the correct time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The software is written in Propeller Spin for the Propeller microcontroller. The control code is relatively simple, but accounting for backlash in the gears was a challenge. Every 24 hours, the clock automatically re-calibrates itself using the Hall Effect sensors. This was a valuable lesson in compensating for mechanical inconsistencies with software.

				<li>CAD design and CNC toolpaths</li>
				<li>Analog Circuit Exploration</li>
				<li>Hands-on Manufacturing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I completed this project with 2 other MechEs during my 4th year at UVA. We chose Deadpool as the theme for our guitar, and styled the body after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Les_Paul">Gibson Les Paul</a>. We designed the body in Solidworks and used HSMWorks to create the CNC toolpaths. We used a ShopBot CNC router to cut the body out of wood. Constructing the guitar required us to balance manufacturability, aesthetics, acoustics, and structural integrity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We also designed and built 2 analog effect circuits to go with the guitar. This involved building circuits in NI's Multisim and testing them with simulation software, then constructing them on a breadboard. One circuit was a combination of 3 bandpass filters, and the other contained an integrator and an active half-wave rectifier.

				Smart Lighting for City Parks

				Paper Abstract: Smart park lighting has the potential to save energy and improve safety within the City of Charlottesville. Standard park lights remain lit throughout the night regardless of whether or not a user is present, which causes unnecessary energy waste. The City of Charlottesville has expressed an interest in retrofitting some of their park lights with an automated lighting control system. The automated system uses motion sensors to detect when users are on the path. The system turns the lights on when users are present, and turns the lights off otherwise. The goal of this project is to develop a long-term automated control system prototype for the City of Charlottesville's path lights and to test it in a City of Charlottesville park. First and foremost, the system needs to maintain the safety of path travelers while saving energy. Additionally, the system and installation need to be relatively low cost. Trenching between poles to lay the underground wiring is the biggest installation expense for standard light poles. To avoid additional trenching costs, the poles will communicate wirelessly with their neighbors to turn on the lights of surrounding poles. The automated lighting system uses passive infrared (PIR) sensors located on each light pole to detect users on the path. A microcontroller handles the control logic of reading the sensor and determining when a light is turned on or off and when to wirelessly tell neighboring poles to turn on. The lights remain on for a specified timeout period unless motion is detected again. Parameters such as the timeout period and the number of neighboring poles that turn on after motion is detected are wirelessly configurable via a laptop connected to a wireless transceiver. These parameters will be thoroughly tested to ensure sufficient lighting is provided to meet user safety needs. The final deliverable is a reproducible automated lighting prototype with wirelessly configurable parameters installed in a Charlottesville park.

			</ul>
			<p>
				This was the final project for my Integrated Systems Design course. It was intentionally left open ended so that we could embed ourselves in the problem to learn more about user needs and find out what we needed to design on our own. This project was a challenge because our system needed to accept power from a generator hub on the bike, power a light while the user needed it, and alternatively power a USB accessory. Our project team consisted of 2 computer engineers, 2 mechanical engineers, and 1 systems engineer. While we all had our own respective areas of expertise, we were required to interface with each other and understand the different disciplines within the project to ensure smooth integration.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this project I learned a great deal about AC to DC power conversion, the difficulties of working with an inconsistent power supply (the generator hub), and the non-trivial task of getting electrical and mechanical systems to integrate while still meeting design requirements. Specifically, I worked with the electrical design speccing parts and testing generator hubs. I also worked on the HMI and user experience for the system.

			<p>
				This was the final project for my Mechatronics course with a team of 3 MechEs. Using an accelerometer, gyroscope, and ultrasonic sensor, we controlled 2 degrees of freedom of a semi-quadcopter system with 2 propellers. We implemented a Kalman filter to process the noise from the accelerometer and the drift in the gyroscope. The speed of the propellers was controlled using Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control to adjust the power supplied to the motors through an H-Bridge with pulse-width modulation (PWM). I was responsible for the control code and most of the 3D printed parts we designed to create our structure. The code was written in C for the Propeller microcontroller.

			<p>
				This was an independent project I did for fun to build an Arduino controlled slider for taking time-lapses. The slider mounts between two tripods, and a DC motor moves the carriage along the track while the camera takes pictures at an interval. I designed the project in SolidWorks, and 3D printed many of the parts on an Afinia 3D printer. Other parts that were not 3D printed I bought online. I used a horizontal band saw and lathe to modify some aluminum parts, and soldered the electronic parts. This project was inspired by an Instructables.com project for a cheap DSLR slider rail using 3D printed parts. I started this project after my introductory mechatronics course as a way to combine my passions for photography and mechatronics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ensuring smooth motion with 3D printed parts turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated, so the slider did not work as well as I had intended. It was a valuable lesson in understanding when to purchase or "roll-your-own" hardware.

				During my 2nd year at UVA, I completed this project with a SysE and EE major. I was responsible for building the robot and writing the C code to control the robot, which included implementing a state machine.
			</p>
			<p>
				I designed the chassis and mounting for the servo delivery system in Autodesk Inventor. The servo delivery system was 3D printed on an Afinia 3D printer, and the chassis was laser cut acrylic. I also built most of the electronics for the robot, and designed the chassis to fit the battery pack, the Arduino microcontroller, breadboard, motors with encoders, and reflectance sensors.
			</p>
			<p>
				My team finished building our robot first, and our professor used our robot to develop his solution. During the following semester, I worked with my professor to update the code for the robot to be compatible with a WiFi shield that allowed the robot to operate wirelessly.

			<p>
				During my spring semester 2nd year, I was in a group for an Arduino-powered automated desktop greenhouse project. I was responsible for designing, 3D printing, and implementing a servo-motor controlled lid for the greenhouse. I used Autodesk Inventor to design the parts, and they were 3D printed on an ABS-extrusion Afinia printer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During the course of the project, I also began writing a significant portion of the code, and by the end of the project I had written most of the code with assistance from the other team members with debugging. The code was written in C for the Arduino microcontroller. There were also PHP scripts and HTML documents for greenhouse communication with a database and displaying data on a website. For the internet communication, the systems and computer engineer wrote most of the code, but I also assisted with debugging.
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on my performance, the professor invited me to revisit the project the next semester for a cyber-physical security demonstration. We reconstructed the greenhouse and circuit, then modified the code to utilize numerical simulation to predict the temperature and detect when the greenhouse has been tampered with. This project was presented to the UVA Systems Engineering Advisory Panel as a demonstration of student capabilities in the realm of cyber-physical security systems.
